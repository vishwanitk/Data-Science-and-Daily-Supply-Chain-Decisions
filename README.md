# Data-Science-and-Daily-Supply-Chain-Sceitions
Data Science or Decision Support Systems in Daily Supply Chain Sceitions


This project presents a practical implementation of a Decision Support System (DSS) for inventory management using Python and pandas, built on one year of real retail sales data. By integrating ABC analysis, XYZ demand variability, Z-score-based anomaly detection, and Days on Hand (DOH) calculations, the system generates SKU-level actionable insights to optimize stock levels, reduce waste, and automate decision-making. The goal is to move away from intuition-based inventory control toward data-driven, daily decisions that are scalable, repeatable, and aligned with business goals. Ideal for supply chain analysts, warehouse managers, and data science enthusiasts in retail and logistics.
